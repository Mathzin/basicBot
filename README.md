Usage

Chrome is advised to run the bot.
Bookmark the following code. To run the bot, run the bookmark.

javascript:$.getScript('https://cdn.rawgit.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/master/basicBot.js');

If this does not work, go to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yemasthui/basicBot/master/basicBot.js and copy paste its content into your console (accessible in chrome by pressing f12) when on plug.dj in your room.

###Special settings###

For a more detailed explanation: see settingsGuide.md

Standard settings can be used. Both the default settings and an example of a custom settings file (uses the .json extension) are included.
To use a settings file, make a public url for it. An easy way to do this is to upload it to dropbox and get a public link to it.
Include the link (for example www.mysettings.com/settings.json ) like this in your room's description, followed by a space or an enter:

@basicBot=www.mysettings.com/settings.json
